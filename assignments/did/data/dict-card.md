# Difference in Differences (Card & Krueger, 1994)
This file is a dictionary of the data used in the paper *"Minimum Wages and Employment:
A Case Study of the Fast-Food Industry in New Jersey and Pennsylvania"* (Card & Krueger,
1994). This article is the most famous application of a Difference-in-Differences
design.

## Context
In April 1992, the state of New Jersey (NJ) raised the minimum wage from $4.25/hr to
$5.05/hr, while the neighboring state of Pennsylvania (PA) maintained the minimum wage
at $4.25/hr. Classic economic theory suggests that increasing the minimum wage will
reduce employment, and this setting is a natural experiment to empirically test
that hypothesis.

The authors surveyed fast-food restaurants in PA and NJ before and after the policy.
Using a DiD design, they compared the average number of employees between both groups
and found that the salary increase did not reduce employment in NJ. This seemingly
counterintuitive result is often referred to as the Card-Krueger paradox.
